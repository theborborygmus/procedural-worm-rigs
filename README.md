---For the rig with legs:
Automated rig that generates a rig for a caterpillar/centipede like animal.
The unique feature of this rig is that it has an automated trailing effect; by moving any joint, the joints under the hierarchy follow a similar path.

---For the rigs with animation:
Building upon the procedural caterpillar rig an automated animation was explored. 
For simplicity's sake, the appendages of the rig were removed.

There is a "target" point that generated rigs will move towards upon running the program. 
The target can be key framed so that the rigs can "chase" a keyframed target. 
There is a subtle side to side (snaking) movement that is also featured to better capture the movement of certain animals (such as snakes) that would require this type of rig.
